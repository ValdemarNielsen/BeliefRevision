Write an input

We are using the following syntax to describe and update the belief base:
“And”, “or”, “not”, “implies”, is described by “&”, “|”, “~”, “>>”.
The operator equivalent is also included, however it has to be written in a different syntax than usual.
An example of this is the following: ( a >> b ) & ( b >> a).


You can also input “Not (A)” and it will transform it to “[~A]” instead - using correct syntax.
